Create a Snowflake account: To get started with Snowflake, we create an account on the Snowflake website. We used the enterprise version.

Create a Snowflake warehouse,database: Once you have a Snowflake account, the next step is to create a warehouse. There are various sizes of the warehouse. 
You can choose based on your requirements. We need to take ninto account the role which creates the warehouse and datbase.If needed provide the access to other roles.

Load data into Snowflake: After creating a database, you can start loading data into Snowflake. You can load data from various sources, including files, databases, and data warehouses. 
We did 2 types: manual and by connecting S3.

Manual: Is wherein you write the SQL queries to insert the data into the table
S3: The data files are stored in S3 buckets,we connect our Snowflake accounts and S3 bucket. For this we need to update the IAM trust policies.

Query data in Snowflake: Snowflake provides a powerful SQL interface for querying data. 

Manage users and security: Snowflake provides a robust security model that allows you to control access to your data. You can create users and roles, grant and revoke privileges, and monitor user activity.
